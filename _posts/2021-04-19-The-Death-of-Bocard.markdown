The death of Bocard hit Halton hardest. It was his doing that led one of his company to doom, and it was his guilt to carry. Much of the sneering and oogling he delt with in towns was going to haunt him. Townsfolk like what they are used to seeing, surprises bother them and often times it hits in him the coinpurse. He had no belief in the ways of man, his concern was cold hard steel and the companionship to thwart evil.

I'm the only follower of my own company, none of them believe in what we are. But company is life. The unity of people to fight is my divine way. What I didn't understand the day Bocard died was that this company would be my life, it would be all I stand for in this world. This baron looting world. With greed and excess to those who champion themselves above all else. Some day Haltons Hero's would conqure even the gods, but that was not this day. Today was a day of morning those lost in battle. This day we honor the fallen heros, we lay to rest their journey and open ourselves to adventure.
