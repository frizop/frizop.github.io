The death of bocard hit Halaton hardest. It was his doing that led one of his company to doom, and it was his guilt to carry. Much of the sneering and oogling he delt with in towns was going to haunt him. Townsfolk like what they are used to seeing, surprises bother them and often times it hits in him the coinpurse. He had no belief of the ways of man, his concern was cold hard steel and nothing else. 

I'm the only follower of my own company, none of them believe they are in a company. But company is life. The unity of people to fight is my divine way. 

What I didn't understand the day Bocard died was that this company would be my life, it would be all I stand for in this world. This baron looting world.
