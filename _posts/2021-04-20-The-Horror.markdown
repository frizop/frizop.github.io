The horror of living longer than the fallen became apparent to Halton on the evening of some unknown day. The company had lost track of time, running for our lives from the monstrosity that lived in a dungeon we recently explored. This.. thing, this horror has fed on the bones of those who dare to enter it's hovel. It's midnight colored fur was made from the dreams of fallen heros, its eyes hardly visiable against obsidian fur, making the creature hard to follow even to those with superior vision.

This evil incantation of horror, assembled by lunacy and bound to commit heionus acts, was after the company. A Company patting itself on the back for a job well done. How little we knew, how slopy we were.
