I awoke to noise, it sounded like twigs snapping, the leaves rustling, perhaps man eating an apple? Joshuwa cried out in pain, the thing from last night was chewing on him. 

I rose to axe and shield, yelling for all to wake. It was back. I swong weakly at it and eventually it fell. It lay maimed. No longer moving, we continued. 

Hacking and slicing with only one question on our minds. How?

It mattered not now, after we were sure the thing could not physically move we gathered oil and tree to burn the damned thing. It smelled of flesh and fur. I stared until it was only ash, long would I not take my eyes from the damned thing.
